# Angular Rock, Paper, Scissors ✊📄✂️

This is a simple Angular 19 project that demonstrates event-driven gameplay, state management, conditional rendering, and image-based interaction using a classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game.

---

## 🔧 What I Built

I developed a standalone `GameComponent` that enables users to play **Rock, Paper, Scissors** against a computer opponent using:

- Angular CLI 19.1.8  
- Standalone components  
- Button click interactions  
- Conditional logic and DOM updates  
- SVG/IMG-based user interface  
- Clean HTML + SCSS styling

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Three selectable options: Rock, Paper, Scissors  
- Computer randomly picks its own choice  
- Winner determined based on classic game logic  
- Displays results with matching images for both players  
- Fully responsive and interactive layout  

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Angular 19 (with standalone component architecture)  
- TypeScript for game logic  
- HTML & SCSS for structure and styling  
- Conditional rendering with `*ngIf`  
- Event binding with `(click)`  
- Dynamic image loading via property binding
